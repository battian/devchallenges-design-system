### [Button components](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY)

Challenge: Create a reusable button with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Don’t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- **User story**: I can see different button types: default, outline and text;
- **User story**: I can choose to disable box-shadow;
- **User story**: I can choose to disable button;
- **User story**: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right;
- **User story**: I can have different button sizes;
- **User story**: I can have different colors;
- **User story**: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators;
- **User story**: I can still access all button attributes;
- **User story** (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough.
